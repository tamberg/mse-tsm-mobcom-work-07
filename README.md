### a) Android BLE scanner, 10'
* Build and run the [MyBleScannerApp example code](https://github.com/tamberg/mse-tsm-mobcom/tree/master/07/Android/MyBleScannerApp).
* Check the Logcat output with filter "MainActivity".
* If it works, you should see BLE devices around you.
* Test the app by disabling Bluetooth, location, etc.
* Done? Add a button to the UI to start a scan. 

### b) Android BLE central, 10'
* Build and run the [MyBleCentralApp example code](https://github.com/tamberg/mse-tsm-mobcom/tree/master/07/Android/MyBleCentralApp).
* Also, a nRF52840 with [HRM BLE peripheral code](https://github.com/tamberg/mse-tsm-mobcom/blob/master/06/Arduino/nRF52840Sense_HrmBlePeripheral/nRF52840Sense_HrmBlePeripheral.ino).
* Check the Logcat output with filter "MainActivity".
* If it works, you should see heart rate measurements.
* Done? Read the Android app source code in detail.

### c) Android BLE issues, 10'
* It looks easy, but BLE on Android has many issues.
* Read some of the tips how to [make it actually work](https://punchthrough.com/android-ble-development-tips/).
* Also check this [list of issues](https://github.com/iDevicesInc/SweetBlue/wiki/Android-BLE-Issues) to get an impression.
* iOS BLE seems more stable. Why could that be?
* Done? Find some stats about the Android OS.

### d) nRF Toolbox Plugin, 30'
* The [nRF Toolbox app](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Toolbox) allows to write new plugins.
* Build and run the [nRF Toolbox app source code](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Toolbox).
* [Write a plugin](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Toolbox/tree/master/app/src/main/java/no/nordicsemi/android/nrftoolbox/template) for a custom SHT30 BLE service.
* Done? Create a custom icon for your service.
